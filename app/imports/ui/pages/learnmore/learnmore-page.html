      <h1>Why use UHvibe ?</h1>
      <div class="description">
        <h3>University of Hawaii has 10 campuses and additional educational and research facilities across the State of Hawaii.
          Thus, the community is very large and diverse. Unfortunately, there are very little ways to find and connect with
          others based on their music 'vibe'. UHvibe offers a way to overcome these issues.</h3>
