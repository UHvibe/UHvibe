          <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1></div>
        <br>
        University of Hawaii has 10 campuses and additional educational and research facilities across the State of
        Hawaii.
        Thus, the community is very large and diverse. Unfortunately, there are very little ways to find and connect
        with
        others based on their music. UHvibe offers a way to overcome these issues.
